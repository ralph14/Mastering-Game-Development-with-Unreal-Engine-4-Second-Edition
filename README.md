This is the code repository for [Mastering Game Development with Unreal Engine 4](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-game-development-unreal-engine-4-second-edition), published by Packt.

**Build high-performance AAA games with UE 4**

## What is this book about?
To make a basic combat game from scratch, you will quickly override existing UE4 classes, and add and implement simple C++ functions while running and building them. These are all discussed as a short summary for new developers and as a quick refresher for experienced developers. Next, you will build a combat player character with expanded controls, create logic for a character, swap weapons, attack and move, bridge over scene changes and transitions, retain data between scenes, and manage the scene-change process.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* The fundamentals of a combat-based game that will let you build and work all other systems from the core gameplay: the input, inventory, A.I. enemies, U.I., and audio
* Manage performance tools and branching shaders based on platform capabilities in the Material Editor
* Explore scene or level transitions and management strategies
* Improve visuals using UE4 systems such as Volumetric Lightmaps, Precomputed Lighting, and Cutscenes
* Implement audio-to-animation timelines and trigger them from visual FX
